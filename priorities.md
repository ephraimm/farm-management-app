## Development Guidelines

### Each Feature Implementation Should:
1. Include tests (unit, integration)
2. Include documentation
3. Follow established patterns
4. Consider offline-first approach
5. Include error handling
6. Consider performance impact

### Before Moving to Next Priority:
1. Complete thorough testing
2. Document any technical debt
3. Review performance metrics
4. Get user feedback
5. Update documentation

### Technical Considerations:
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow component composition patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Consider bundle size impact
- Maintain consistent styling
- Follow accessibility guidelines

### Quality Metrics:
- Test coverage > 80%
- Lighthouse score > 90
- Bundle size < 200KB initial load
- Time to interactive < 3s
- Offline functionality 100%

This prioritization ensures:
- Solid foundation for future features
